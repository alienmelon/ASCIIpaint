# ASCIIpaint

From http://ascii.alienmelon.com/

A tiny ASCII art paint program written in javascript.
Everything is cointained in the index.html page because it's very small and I wasn't planning on sharing this.

The program allows you to freehand draw ASCII art and then output that to a text friendly version to easily copy/paste your art wherever you like.
You can choose from a number of ASCII formats to draw with, as well as inputing your own.
There's also an ASCII eraser, and you can change the size of the ASCII canvas!
(this is not mobile friendly. I was too tired to mess with touch events)
